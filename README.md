# Portfolio Project

This portfolio project is the first assignment for the She Codes Plus course.
Its main purpose is to showcase the collection of projects completed.

# Wireframe

The wireframe for this portfolio project was created used Mockflow.
It consists of three pages:
  - A home page with a brief "about me" section as well as "my stack" section, highlighting the technologies I know (or will know, by the end of the course)
  - A projects page with links to the different projects;
  - A contact form to get in touch.

The wireframe started as a very simple black and white layout. 

Throughout the development of the portfolio, as I was implementing the features, I gradually and exponentially added graphic elements.

# Typography

The font used for this project is Montserrat sans serif: I chose it because of the easy readability.

I tried to make the website as accessible as possible, using "alt" attributes and mouseover titles for images.

# Brand Colours

The original wireframe only consisted of a simple black and white layout with neon green accents, as I was focused on the functionality.
The subsequent iterations saw the colour palette change dramatically.

The background colours alternate between pages:

*Home Page* and *Contact Page*
Body background : #f5f0e1
Text and header/footer background : #1e3d59
Active states and decorations are #ff6e40
Hover state for the nav bar is #ffc13b

*Projects Page*

Body background and nav bar text : #1e3d59
Text and header/footer background : #f5f0e1
Active states and decorations : #ff6e40
Hover states for the projects: #ff6e40
Hover state for the nav bar : #ffc13b
